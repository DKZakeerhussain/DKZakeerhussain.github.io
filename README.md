### Technical Skills : Python, SQL, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning

### EDUCATION
- MTech, Data science | Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune | (May-2024)
- BTech, Mechanical Engineering | Visvesvaraya Technological University |(June-2019)

### PROJECTS
#### GENERALIZING THE UNSEEN
- The project aimed at addressing the limitations of supervised classifiers that rely largely
on labeled data and fail to classify unknown classes
- we devised a framework utilizing an attention mechanism combined
with a zero-shot learning approach, effectively overcoming these
challenges
- By focusing on the most relevant image regions for each attribute and
enabling classification of previously unseen classes

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, PyTorch, Streamlit

#### Blog Generation using LLM 

## Description
This project involves creating a Blog Generation application that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate blog content. The app is built using Streamlit for the user interface, Hugging Face for model deployment, and the LLama-2-13b-chat pretrained model for the blog generation. Users can select from three main categories: Researchers, Students, and Common People, and specify the area or topic they want to write about. The application then generates a blog post tailored to their needs.

## Features
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Blog generation using LLama-2-13b-chat pretrained model.
- Ability to choose the target audience: Researchers, Students, or Common People.
- Topic customization based on user input.
- Deployment on Hugging Face for easy access and scalability.

** Technologies Used: ** Python, Streamlit, Hugging Face, LLama-2-13b-chat

#### Extraction Tool - A Generative AI Project

## Description
This project involves creating an Extraction Tool that utilizes Generative AI to process any given URLs, extract the texts, and then provide summaries or Q&A about the article. The application uses OpenAI or LLama as the language models (LLMs), Pinecone as the vector database (VectorDB), SentenceTransformer or OpenAI embeddings for embeddings, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features
- Extract text from any given URL.
- Generate summaries of the extracted text.
- Provide Q&A functionality based on the extracted text.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Efficient text search and retrieval using Pinecone as the vector database.
- High-quality embeddings using SentenceTransformer or OpenAI embeddings.

** Technologies Used: ** Python, Streamlit, OpenAI, LLama, Pinecone, SentenceTransformer, OpenAI embeddings

#### AnyPDFSummarizer - A Generative AI Project

## Description
This project involves creating a tool that takes any given PDF, extracts the text, and provides summaries or Q&A based on the content of the PDF. The application leverages OpenAI or LLama as the language models (LLMs), Pinecone as the vector database (VectorDB), SentenceTransformer or OpenAI embeddings for embeddings, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features
- Extract text from any given PDF.
- Generate summaries of the extracted text.
- Provide Q&A functionality based on the extracted text.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Efficient text search and retrieval using Pinecone as the vector database.
- High-quality embeddings using SentenceTransformer or OpenAI embeddings.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Streamlit, OpenAI, LLama, Pinecone, SentenceTransformer, OpenAI embeddings, PyMuPDF (for PDF text extraction)

#### REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION
- The objective of the project is to identify and track objects in videos
or images with high accuracy and speed
- Implementing the pretrained YOLOv5 model on the created dataset
which consists of 20 classes
- Annotation of the dataset is carried out by using the CVAT tool

**Technologies Used:** Python, Tensorflow, CVAT tool, 

#### OBJECT DETECTION USING DETR
- Implemented object detection using the DETR (DEtection
Transfomer) architecture on a custom dataset, achieving accurate and
efficient localization of objects within images.
- Successfully trained and fine-tuned the DETR model on the custom
dataset, demonstrating proficiency in adapting transformer-based
architectures for specific object detection tasks

**Technologies Used:** Python, PyTorch, Streamlit,
