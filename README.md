### PROJECTS
#### GENERALIZING THE UNSEEN*
- The project aimed at addressing the limitations of supervised classifiers that rely largely
on labeled data and fail to classify unknown classes
- we devised a framework utilizing an attention mechanism combined
with a zero-shot learning approach, effectively overcoming these
challenges
- By focusing on the most relevant image regions for each attribute and
enabling classification of previously unseen classes
 

#### REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION
- The objective of the project is to identify and track objects in videos
or images with high accuracy and speed
- Implementing the pretrained YOLOv5 model on the created dataset
which consists of 20 classes
- Annotation of the dataset is carried out by using the CVAT tool

#### OBJECT DETECTION USING DETR
- Implemented object detection using the DETR (DEtection
Transfomer) architecture on a custom dataset, achieving accurate and
efficient localization of objects within images.
- Successfully trained and fine-tuned the DETR model on the custom
dataset, demonstrating proficiency in adapting transformer-based
architectures for specific object detection tasks
