### EDUCATION
- MTech, Data science | Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune | (May-2024)
- BTech, Mechanical Engineering | Visvesvaraya Technological University |(June-2019)

### PROJECTS
#### GENERALIZING THE UNSEEN*
- The project aimed at solving the problem of weakly labeled data and
encountering unseen classes while testing the model
- Zero-shot learning approach has been used to overcome the
above-stated problems
- Applied approach is the usage of a Vision Transformer model with an
attention mechanism

#### REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION
- The objective of the project is to identify and track objects in videos
or images with high accuracy and speed
- Implementing the pretrained YOLOv5 model on the created dataset
which consists of 20 classes
- Annotation of the dataset is carried out by using the CVAT tool
