### PROJECTS
#### GENERALIZING THE UNSEEN
- The project aimed at addressing the limitations of supervised classifiers that rely largely
on labeled data and fail to classify unknown classes
- we devised a framework utilizing an attention mechanism combined
with a zero-shot learning approach, effectively overcoming these
challenges
- By focusing on the most relevant image regions for each attribute and
enabling classification of previously unseen classes

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, PyTorch, Streamlit

### Blog Generation using LLM 

**Description**
This project involves creating a Blog Generation application that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate blog content. The app is built using Streamlit for the user interface, Hugging Face for model deployment, and the LLama-2-13b-chat pretrained model for the blog generation. Users can select from three main categories: Researchers, Students, and Common People, and specify the area or topic they want to write about. The application then generates a blog post tailored to their needs.

**Features**
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Blog generation using LLama-2-13b-chat pretrained model.
- Ability to choose the target audience: Researchers, Students, or Common People.
- Topic customization based on user input.
- Deployment on Hugging Face for easy access and scalability.
